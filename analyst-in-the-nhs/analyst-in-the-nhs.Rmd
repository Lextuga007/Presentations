# Not a typical journey


???

A nice contrast to Sammi and perhaps many people watching this is that many analysts in the NHS don't have data science degrees or masters, or even numerate degrees.

# My background

--

I studied Philosophy as an undergraduate degree

--

My first job after university was on an IT helpdesk

--

My first job in the NHS was as a secretary

--

I was an analyst for about 10 years and I've worked in 2 NHS organisations that no longer exist

???

None of this is to dissuade anyone from doing a degree or a masters, in fact, I've been interested in doing one myself but need to find the time! This is to illustrate how there isn't a typical analyst/data scientist route into the NHS.

# Data

*Data* - I love transforming data and the complexity of healthcare data. I'm pretty sure my analytical skills are transferable but there is nothing quite like healthcare data in all its messy glory!

# People

*People* - finding the right team matters and working to make the lives of the people around me matters too. I feel strongly that I am a patient, my family and friends are patients and I want these services to be the best they can be.

# Change

???

*Changes* - We are not exactly start ups in the NHS and things can go exceedingly slowly but working with analysts who have been using R for the best part of 15 years, I hear from them how hard things were then compared to now (thanks to NHS-R Community and PyCom). 

It's easy to not to see how far things have changed and how close we are to the cusp of, I hope, momentous change for the analyst profession as a whole.

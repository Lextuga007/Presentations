# Do you have any unusual Christmas traditions?...

## Seasonal question time...

What is the likelihood of having a Christmas birthday?

* Highly likely
* Same as any other day
* Not likely

## ONS have answered this!

[How popular is your birthday?](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/howpopularisyourbirthday/2015-12-18)

"While the Christmas holidays may be a popular time to make a baby there tend to be fewer babies born, with 6 of the 10 least popular dates of birth falling in the Christmas and New Year period."

# This needs a chart...

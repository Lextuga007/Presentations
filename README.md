East Midlands [AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts)](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) branch meeting 1st November 2019.

I used this presentation to cover the steps I took (and mistakes I made) in creating one table from many sources in SQL for mortality surveillance within a large NHS secondary care provider trust.

I presented this particular presentation at:

* East Midlands [AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts)](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) branch meeting 1st November 2019
* R-Ladies London 30th July 2019 
* NHS-R Community Conference 4-5th November 2019 lightning talk [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) 

I used this presentation to show how I had used R to create a mortality surveillance report. It is related to the [Mortality surveillance slides](https://lextuga007.github.io/Presentations/mortality/MortalitySQL.html) in that this was the analysis part of the surveillance.

## Lightning Talk Women In Tech

Lightning talk (5 mins): Equality in NHS Analysis, December 2019

* [Slides](https://github.com/Lextuga007/Presentations/blob/main/women-in-tech/LightningTalkNHSR.pdf)
</br>
* [Code]()

I presented at [Women In Tech in Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com/wit-notts) to show some of the numbers (visually) around the male/female ratio of attendees to the [](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) courses and meetups I've helped to arrange in Nottingham.

It was also a way of showing how 20% is more meaningful when related to a real situation.

The presentation was built in R Markdown and used the viridis package for accessible and contrasting colours, and the waffle package to represent numbers/people.

The presentation was a brief introduction to the [qicharts2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qicharts2/vignettes/qicharts2.html) package and I used Crimea war numbers as collected by Florence Nightingale.

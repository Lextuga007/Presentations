Note that there is a blank slide which is a graph created using the dygraph package. This doesn't appear in pdfs but reproducible code to create a chart (with generated data) can be followed at https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/dygraphs or from https://github.com/Lextuga007/NHSR_blogs/tree/master/Dygraphs_ZTurner_201909

I used this presentation to cover the steps I took (and mistakes I made) in creating one table from many sources in SQL for mortality surveillance within a large NHS secondary care provider Trust.

I used this presentation to show how R had been used to create a mortality surveillance report. 

**Note that there is a blank slide** which is a graph created using the dygraph package. This doesn't appear in pdfs but reproducible code to create a chart (with generated data) can be followed at https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/dygraphs or from https://github.com/Lextuga007/NHSR_blogs/tree/master/Dygraphs_ZTurner_201909 

## LightningTalkNHSR.html

I presented a 5 minute Lightning Talk at Women In Tech in Nottingham to show some of the numbers (visually) around the male/female ratio of attendees to the https://nhsrcommunity.com/ courses and meetups I've helped to arrange in Nottingham.

It was also a way of showing how 20% is more meaningful when related to a real situation.

The presentation was built in R Markdown and used the viridis package for accessible and contrasting colours, and the waffle package to represent numbers/people.

## NHS-R Community Meetup

Repository is [here](https://github.com/Lextuga007/NHS-R-Community-Meetup)

The presentation was a brief introduction to the [qicharts2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qicharts2/vignettes/qicharts2.html) package and used Crimea war numbers as collected by Florence Nightingale. 

## NHS-R Conference 2020

Lightning talk: Why do I need to learn R when I can use SQL? on Monday 9th November 2020. 

Slides incorporated the NHS and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust fonts, colours and backgrounds courtesy of the [workshop](https://spcanelon.github.io/xaringan-basics-and-beyond/index.html) by Silvia Canel√≥n.

# Public Transport and access

class: middle

# Background

* Pre-Covid I was an avid public transport user
* Nottingham/shire public transport system is radial 
* All buses and trams go to the centre and (almost) to the Acute hospital

[<img class="center" alt="Map of the bus and tram routes to Nottingham City showing how the routes all radiate from the centre outwards with few links that go around the city." src="img/NottsHistoryByBusmap.jpg" width="40%"/>](http://historybybus.blogspot.com/)

# As the crow flies

A lot of people drive... Highbury Hospital (a Mental Health Hospital)

# As the crow flies

A great majority of people people who commission services don't use public transport

# Public Transport comparison

Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust moved services from the Acute Hospital to a purpose built building. 

How would this affect people travelling by public transport?

![Two maps side by side with Hopewood and Queens Medical Centre public transport time highlighted. Both can be reached by much of Nottingham but Hopewood has links to northern villages and QMC has south west village links.](img/weekday-am-pt-hopewood-qmc.PNG)

# Drive time comparison

# Does public transport matter?

What do the general public use?

# Challenges using SHAPE

1. The colours for 30 minutes areas are pale

--

1. Colours for travel time can't be changed

--

1. Sizing of the map showing varies according to the detail - images are not like for like

--

1. Copying and pasting is clunky (used Snipping Tool)

---

# Great features of SHAPE

1. Public sector facilities are all available (Nottshc has 378 sites)

--

1. It's possible to add new facilities manually 

--

1. It's a great exploratory tool

--

1. It's free to public sector and it has been updated so is well supported

--

1. It's much more than a transport mapping tool of course!

--

1. The site is great for staying logged into and remembering your password. It's a small thing but I do appreciate this a lot.

# Download data

It's possible to download the data for the travel times but note this needs to be done by each time travel segment and selection of population is required before the Export button appears.

```{r, out.width="49%", out.height="20%", alt="Images of the selections on travel time of 30 minutes and full population to show the menu requrired to get the export button next to an image of the extracted data"}

knitr::include_graphics(c("img/export-travel-data.PNG","img/export-travel-extract.PNG"))
```

# Data help

Information on the methodology and limitations is comprehensive:

# Extract of methodology

</br>
</br>
</br>

> Public transport: EXPERIMENTAL: uses buses, trams and rail but coverage across some areas may be inconsistent. Options allow travel either to or from the sites and selection of weekday morning, afternoon and evening travel times. The algorithm for calculating the distances that can be travelled from any point assumes that someone can walk from the start location, catch a bus or a train from a known stop, get off at another stop and potentially walk again – or even catch another bus or train. Generally works best when used for a single selected site, rather than multiple sites.

# Accessiblity

The [accessibility statement](https://shapeatlas.net/accessibility-statement/) is on the [front page](https://shapeatlas.net/) before logging in and is located on the side bar. 

Once logged in though it isn't clear how to get back to this front page.

To get around this open in a different browser (particularly if the remember password has been selected!)

For the last 3 years I've worked as a Senior Information Analyst 

```{r Trust, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/company_logo.jpg")

```


## Some statistics about the NHS

Women/Female

```{r NHS Stats, out.width="600px"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/NHSWorkforceStats.PNG")

```

# And in analyst teams...

## Programming

#rstats

```{r NHSR, out.width = "250px"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/NHSRLogo.png")

```

## But...

20% of attendees at local FREE R courses and events are (assumed not declared) female.

Not all attendees are NHS staff.


## Meaningful?

20% = 20 in 100

```{r 2 in 100}

percentage <- c(female = 20, male = 80)

waffle(percentage, rows = 10,
       colors = c("#73D055FF", "#FDE725FF"), title = "Percentage")

```


## 1 in 5

20% also equals:

```{r 1 in 5}

fraction <- c(female = 1, male = 4)

waffle(fraction, rows = 1,
       colors = c("#73D055FF", "#FDE725FF"), title = "Fraction")


```

# What we see...

## In the training

```{r 4 in 20}

training <- c(female = 4, male = 16)

waffle(training, rows = 4,
       colors = c("#73D055FF", "#FDE725FF"), title = "Training")

```

## Our Meetup

```{r 2 in 10}

meetup <- c(me = 1, female = 1, male = 8)

waffle(meetup, rows = 2,
       colors = c("#440154FF","#73D055FF", "#FDE725FF"), title = "Last Meetup")

```

## R Ladies

For people who identify as a woman or gender minority and are interested in the R programming language

https://rladies.org/


```{r RLadies, out.width = "250px"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/R-LadiesGlobal.png")

```

## Our Analyst team

```{r managers}

managers <- c(female = 4, male = 1)

analysts <- c(female = 2, male = 19)

iron(
  
waffle(managers, rows = 1,
       colors = c("#440154FF","#73D055FF"), title = "Managers"),

waffle(analysts, rows = 3,
       colors = c("#440154FF","#73D055FF"), title = "Analysts")
)

```
